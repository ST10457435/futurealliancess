    <h1>Welcome to the FutureQuest Alliance</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to FutureQuest Alliance, where our mission is to bridge the educational resource gap for underprivileged schools across South Africa. Our platform is designed to connect schools in need with donors, volunteers, and educational resources, creating a collaborative network dedicated to enhancing educational opportunities and outcomes. Through the past years we have seen that there is no equality in the education sector in our country, so we want to be the people who bring change—ensuring we have many future leaders. We encourage everyone in the country to give our website a try.

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
      At FutureQuest Alliance, we understand the challenges faced by underprivileged schools, from a lack of essential resources and technology to limited access to qualified teachers. Our goal is to address these disparities by facilitating meaningful connections and transparent resource allocation through our innovative platform.
